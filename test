// To create a static keyword youneed to be using a block,variable,method or,nested class, 
Make sure to put its declaration with the keyword static. 
When its declared static, it can be accessed before any objects 
of its class are created, and without reference to any object.

class Test
{
    // static variable
    static String a = "The Tight Ten";
    static String b;
      
    // static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
        b = a + "is one big family";
    }
  
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       System.out.println("from main");
       System.out.println("Value of a : "+a);
       System.out.println("Value of b : "+b);
    }
}
